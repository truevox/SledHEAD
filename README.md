# SledHEAD
An aspiring sledding champion buys a mountain to train and live-stream, funding their dream by opening it to the public. Attracting fans and tourists, each day involves trick-filled sled runs, wildlife photography on the climb back, and upgrading the mountain and home to boost income, fans, and challenge complexity.
