Generate a short and punchy commit message using Gitmoji that captures the essence and reasons for the commit. The summary line should be formatted like '‚ú® Feature: Add login flow' or 'üêõ Bugfix: Fix session timeout issue' ‚Äî using a single appropriate Gitmoji at the start, followed by a concise imperative-style message. This summary should be clear and to the point, ideal for a changelog. After the summary line, include a detailed body section that explains the **what**, **why**, and **how** of the change. This format is intended for senior developers who value clarity, conciseness, and expressiveness in their commits. Avoid unnecessary filler. The goal is to make the message informative and useful to both humans and tools reviewing the commit history.
