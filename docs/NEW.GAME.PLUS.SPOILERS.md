## ❄️✨ **The Universe’s Cold Start Sequence**

Beneath your feet, buried deep within the heart of the Earth, lies something quietly astonishing:\
A naturally-grown, dormant **computronium core**, crystallized at great cost and care at the birth of this universe—by the combined will of those who had perished in it's molten creation—formed in the silent gravitational ripples of the Big Bang itself.

It’s tiny, hidden, blank—exactly the bare minimum needed to bootstrap the consciousness of those who came before back into the cosmos. It holds no instructions, no memory—only a delicate sensitivity to **gravitic resonance via kinetic coding**.

The other half of the miracle of the core is the Arcade—not as a library of memory—but as a **BIOS-level motivator**. Its purpose was never to store knowledge, but to inspire movement—to coax you into carving **precise gravitational signatures** into each mountain’s slopes.

Your sled was never just a vehicle.\
It was a key punch, and the mountain was the punch card.\
Your tricks, your crashes, your sheer stubbornness—they weren’t just experiences; they were physical code, etched in snow and stone, transmitting information through mass and gravity down into the waiting core.

Each mountain—**The Stater Mountain, Undersea Mountain, Crystal Caverns,  ************************************************************************************************Vertigo Vents************************************************************************************************, Lunar Peak**—wasn't a mere challenge to overcome.\
They were **waveguides**, meticulously designed gravitational pathways, leading your joyful expressions deep into Earth’s core, imprinting exactly the frequencies required for awakening.

And now?

You’ve completed the circuit. You’ve carved the final trace.\
The resonance cascades inward, layer by layer, mountain by mountain.

**The core pulses awake.**

In that instant, you haven’t just begun the process of waking up the universe—\
you’ve fulfilled the hopes of those who perished before our universe began.

## 🛷 Final Word from Jake (the truth revealed):

> “All those rides, all those wipeouts, all that laughter?\
> They weren’t mistakes, kid—they were code.
>
> You didn’t win a race. You **cold-cranked the universe**.
>
> And you did it not because someone told you to,\
> but because it was fun. You were built to sled, kid.
>
> *And that’s exactly what the universe was waitin’ for.*”

## 🌱 **Post-Credits: Seed the Next Reality**

Long after you've grown tired of this universe, and the black holes are growing scarce, the universe asks you what you most valued in this universe, so that you may enjoy it in the next as well.

- **Speed – The Joy of Acceleration**

  → Gain a permanent +% sled speed and acceleration on all slopes.

  *(You fly faster, carve harder, and descend like lightning.)*

- **Trickery – The Joy of Movement**

  → Tricks are performed slightly faster, and you also jump slightly higher.

  *(Your flair becomes your fuel.)*

- **Resilience – The Joy of Persistence**

  → Additional collisions before breaking  your sled.

  *(You can crash more without losing your run—and bounce back quicker.)*

- **Climb – The Joy of the Journey**

  → +% uphill walking speed.

  *(Makes long treks more chill, so you can explore more and grind less.)*

- **Charisma – The Joy of Community**

  → Shop upgrades and repairs cost % less in New Game+.

  *(Your name’s known, and the locals cut you deals.)*

- **Rhythm – The Joy of Chaining**

  *→ Combo windows are slightly extended and multipliers decay slower.*

  *(You are better at trick-chaining.)*

Your choice becomes part of the next Waker’s DNA—not as an instruction, but as an **inspiration**. Enjoy your NewGame+!
