# 📍 **SledHEAD Comprehensive Development Roadmap**

This document outlines the detailed path from the current implementation to the complete "1.0" version of **SledHEAD**, including the critical gameplay shift to an **Up-Then-Down** stamina-based mechanic.

---

## 🎯 **Core Concept**
You are an **aspiring sledding champion** who has purchased an entire **procedurally generated mountain** to train and broadcast your extreme sled runs. To fund your dream, you’ve opened the slopes to the public, attracting:

- **Casual Tourists** – Regular visitors who use the mountain but don’t care about you.  
- **Fans & Followers** – Devoted viewers who cheer, hype you up, and even offer in-game boosts.  

Your goal is to master the mountain, **optimize runs for speed and tricks**, and **grow your fanbase**. The **better your performance, the more money you earn**, allowing you to invest in **personal upgrades, and mountain expansions**.

## 🎯 **Gameplay Loop Overview**
- Players start at the mountain's base, managing stamina as they climb upward.
- Strategic decision-making to sled down for rewards before stamina depletion.
- Higher altitudes host rare wildlife, higher rewards, and greater risks.

---

## 🌄 **Segmented Cylinder Wrapping (Layered Mountain Structure)**  
**Handling Horizontal Wrapping at Different Elevations**

To create the effect of a **finite mountain with wraparound sides**, SledHEAD uses a **layered cylindrical system** instead of a continuous cone. The mountain is divided into **stacked segments**, each with its own **fixed circumference** that gets **smaller as you go higher**. This allows for a **consistent wraparound mechanic** while keeping movement predictable.

### 🏔️ **How It Works:**
- Each **layer** is a separate horizontal zone, like a **floating ring** around the mountain.  
- If a player **crosses the left or right boundary** of a layer, they seamlessly wrap around to the other side.  
- **Lower layers are wider**, giving more horizontal space.  
- **Upper layers are narrower**, meaning wraparound happens sooner.  

### ⬆️⬇️ **Moving Between Layers**
When transitioning **between vertical segments**:
1. If the player **moves downward** past the bottom boundary of a layer:
   - They **teleport to the top boundary** of the layer below.  
   - Their **horizontal position scales** based on the new circumference to maintain a proportional location.  
   
   ```pseudocode
   scale_factor = new_layer.circumference / old_layer.circumference
   x_new = x_old * scale_factor

2. If the player **moves upward** past the top boundary of a layer:
   - They **appear at the bottom** of the next layer up with **their horizontal position **scaled.

### 🏁 **Gameplay Implications**
   - Predictable & Manageable: Keeps wraparound and movement feeling natural while allowing for different gameplay per layer.

### **Layer-Specific Challenges**:
   - Broader paths at lower levels = more open sledding.
   - Tighter paths at higher levels = more technical, precision-based gameplay.
   - Performance-Friendly: Each layer is an isolated map segment, simplifying collision checks and procedural generation.

---

## 🌄 **Light/Dark Gradient Altitude System**

- Introduce a dynamic visual gradient where snow and terrain visually shift, with the snow at higher altitudes lighter due to being cleaner, and the snow downhill from you appears darker (due to the dirt and debres that flows down hill). 🚀
- The gradient will provide a dynamic natural visual guide for players to intuitively gauge altitude and plan their climbs and descents. 🎯

---

## 🌎 **Procedural World & Persistence**

- The mountain remains consistent during a playthrough.  
- **New terrain is only generated when starting a new game.**  
- The current **seed is displayed at home**, and players can enter a **custom seed for a specific mountain.**  
- **Changes per run:**
  - Tourists & fans shift positions.  
  - Weather may change dynamically.  
  - Wildlife encounters vary.

---

## 🎢 Gameplay Loops
**Progression Goals:**  
- **Prototype:** Repay the cost of the mountain.  
- **Full Game:**  
  - Stage 1: Repay your house, unlocking initial "Mountain" upgrades like ski lifts.  
  - Stage 2: After paying off your mountain, a much bigger debt unlocks a new mountain (with fresh environments like Lava Mountain, Space Mountain, and Underwater Mountain).  
  - Note: You'll start off with zero mountain upgrades but keep your personal upgrades.  
  - Unique upgrades are required to access each new mountain, with limited availability—though more snowy peaks are always around to explore!
### **⬆️1️⃣ Uphill Phase: Climbing & Exploration**
#### 🚶 **Top-down adventure traversal with stamina management and exploration.**  
- **Goal:** Ascend to the top **by hiking, using ski lifts, snowmobiles, or taking shortcuts**.  
- **Stamina System:**  
  - Stamina drains when moving.  
  - Replenished by **food stands, resting points, or upgrades**.  
- **Wildlife Photography Mini-Game 📸** *(Active only in Uphill Phase)*  
  - **Random animals appear every few seconds (TWEAK variable).**  
  - Animals either **stay still and will run if you get too close.** Eventually they will **wander off**.  
  - **Use the Left & Right Arrow Keys to aim the camera cone** around your character.  
  - **Align the altitude line (using the Up & Down Arrow Keys)** with the animal’s altitude for a perfect shot.  
  - **Photos earn money, with multipliers for:**  
    - Accuracy (center of POV cone).  
    - Altitude match precision.  
    - Moving vs. stationary targets (moving = 3x value).
    - Animal Rarity (more exotic animals the further up the mountain you are).

### **⬇️2️⃣ Sledding Phase (Downhill)**
💨 **Fast-paced, high-speed, gravity-driven sledding with a trick system.**  
- **Goal:** Reach the bottom as efficiently as possible while **navigating obstacles, taking shortcuts, and pulling off tricks** for extra cash.  
- **Terrain:** Procedurally generated **rocks, ramps, cliffs, ski lifts, obstacles, and hidden paths**.  
- **Obstacles:**
  - **Tourists**: Sometimes move out of the way, sometimes don’t.
  - **Fans**: Cheer you on & give you **boosts** if you impress them.
  - **Moving Hazards**: Ski patrol, rogue snowmobiles, loose sleds.  
- **Weather Effects:** Wind, fog, snow drifts, and ice patches change difficulty dynamically.  
- **Time Trials:**  
  - Activated by **hitting a time trial activator** (e.g., checkpoint, gate, or radar timer).  
  - **Your time between activators determines your bonus.**  
  - **Faster times = more money!**  
  - Not all runs are timed; only those where you activate a trial.

### 🏠3️⃣ **Management Phase (House & Upgrades)**
🏡 **Upgrade your gear, mountain, and social media presence.**  
- **Spend earned money on:**
  - **Personal Upgrades:** Increase sledding ability, climbing endurance, photography precision.  
  - **Sled Upgrades:** Speed, handling, trick potential.  
  - **Mountain Upgrades:** Add ski lifts, shops, and fans to boost income & challenge.  
- **New Game Start:**  
  - Mountain **ONLY regenerates when starting a completely new game.**  
  - **A seed system** lets players enter a specific seed for reproducible terrain.  
  - **Current seed is displayed at home.**

## 🏡 **Tutorial Level: Childhood Memories on Grandpa’s Hill**  
**Learning the Basics in a Cozy, Story-Driven Introduction**

Before tackling the **massive procedural mountains** of SledHEAD, players start with a heartwarming **tutorial level**, set in a **quiet rural winter landscape**. This **flashback sequence** lets players experience sledding as a **young child**, learning the fundamental mechanics under the guidance of their **grandfather**.

### 📜 **Narrative Setup**
The game opens on a **small, snow-covered hill** just outside a **cozy cabin**, where the protagonist—**a child version of themselves**—is spending time with their **grandfather** on a crisp winter afternoon. Grandpa is **wrapped up in a warm coat, standing at the base of the hill after sledding down himself**, watching proudly as the player **takes their maiden toboggan run, learning to sled**. The sky glows with the **soft oranges and purples of a winter sunset**, setting a nostalgic and peaceful mood.

Before long, Grandpa gives a gentle laugh:  
> **"Ahh, y'know, I used to be the best sledder on this hill... but these ol' legs don’t have the stamina they used to! You go on, get a few more runs in—I’ll watch and cheer ya on from here! And remember - the snow's always whiter above you, and dirtier below!"**  

With that, the tutorial **fully hands control to the player**, reinforcing the **stamina system** and setting up a meaningful reason to **manage energy wisely**.

---

## 🎮 **Tutorial Mechanics Introduced**
The tutorial unfolds organically through **simple, playful challenges**, without heavy UI elements. Players **learn by doing**, with Grandpa offering **gentle, supportive guidance**.

### **⬆️ Walking Uphill (Basic Movement & Stamina)**
- Players move **uphill by walking**, learning that **whiter snow = uphill, darker snow = downhill**.  
- Moving uphill **drains stamina** gradually.  
- Grandpa occasionally calls out:
  > **"You’re strong, kid! But ya gotta pace yourself—harder climbs mean ya gotta rest up after!"**

### **🛷 Sledding Downhill (Turning & Speed Control)**
- Players start **at the top of the small hill** and practice their **first sled run**.  
- **Turning left/right** is introduced, along with simple speed adjustments.  
- Grandpa **cheers when the player makes a smooth turn**:
  > **"Look at that! You’re a natural! Sleddin’s all about balance—lean just right and the hill will do the rest!"**

### **🔄 Climbing & Repeating Runs**
- After a few runs, Grandpa suggests:
  > **"Why don’t ya take a few more runs? See if ya can get all the way to the bottom without wipin’ out!"**  
- The player is **free to keep practicing**, reinforcing that **sledding is about trial and improvement**.  
- The game subtly **introduces self-motivated play**, rewarding experimentation.

### **🏁 Tutorial Completion**
- Once the player **feels confident**, a final sled run **transitions seamlessly into the present day**, cutting to the **modern protagonist** standing atop their massive new mountain.
- **Grandpa’s words echo**, setting the tone for the adventure ahead:
  > **"One day, you’ll take on bigger mountains than this… but no matter how high you go, never forget the joy of the ride."**  
- The camera pulls back, revealing the **full mountain**, and gameplay transitions into the **core SledHEAD experience**.

---

## ✨ **Why This Works**
- **Emotionally Engaging** – Connects the player to their childhood roots and motivation.  
- **Smooth Learning Curve** – Teaches fundamental mechanics **without forced tutorials**.  
- **Worldbuilding & Nostalgia** – Grandpa’s wisdom adds charm and meaning to the stamina system.  
- **Seamless Transition to Main Game** – Keeps momentum going without feeling like a "tutorial level."  

This opening ensures that **players feel connected to their journey**—from childhood sledding to **becoming a sledding legend**. 🎿🔥

## ⚖️ Weight is Strategy: You Climb What You Carry
> “Every bolt, every crate, every choice—the mountain feels it, and so will your legs.”

---

### 🎯 Objective  
Your sled isn’t just a ride down—it’s your **command center** on the climb up. Build light to move fast, or go heavy to haul it all—but remember: **weight is your stamina tax**, and every bolt you bring will cost you on the climb.

Use the **modular sled system** to construct anything from a stripped-down **Jack Jumper** for quick ascents, to a massive **Gravity-Sledge** ready to haul enough maple, honey, gems, ores, and various other treasures to stock a trading post. Wanna haul around the bones of **Champs ancestors** - you need a **Sledge**!

---

### 🛠️ Mechanics  

#### 🔩 Modular Components
- **Swappable Parts:** Core body, rails, skids, front, rear, and side attachables.
- **Minigame Loadouts:** Add-ons for *digging*, *panning*, *beekeeping*, *sap collection*, and more.
- **Inventory Scaling:** Bigger sleds = more storage = longer runs without heading home.
- **Weight Scaling:** But heavier sleds = faster stamina burn on climbs.

#### 🛷 Sled Size Tiers  
- 🐇 **Jack Jumper:** Light, fast, perfect for quick climbs and short missions.  
- 🛷 **Toboggan:** Traditional and reliable—adds more haul space with minimal drag.  
- 🛷 **Bobsled:** Balanced stamina and capacity—a mid-game staple.  
- 🛻 **Gravity-Sledge:** Big boy. Built for long hauls, big rewards, and slow climbs.  
- ⚡ **Powered Sledge:** Endgame gear. Built-in motor is powerful, but runs on fire-seeds from Vertigo Vents.

Modular parts adapt to different terrain types and playstyles. Each mountain introduces new **tiered gear**, encouraging players to craft the perfect sled for the challenge ahead.

Tiers are defined by mountain difficulty:
- **Early Game**: Tutorial + base snow mountain
- **Example Mid Game**: Candy Cane Canyon, Garbage Dump Glacier, Crystal Caves
- **Example Late Game**: Fire Mountain, Space Mountain, Steampunk Slopes

### 💡 Strategy & Loop  
- **Climb Strategy:** Plan your route, weigh the reward. Can you reach the high-level cryptid fossil site with a full panning kit and digging gear? Maybe—but it’ll take stamina.  
- **Run Planning:** Load light for trick runs or fast climbs. Load heavy for treasure, panning, or multi-minigame combos.  
- **Upgrade Path:** Invest in *stamina buffs*, *better wax*, and *sled mods* to offset weight and keep pushing higher.

### 2. **Fishing** 📸🐟  
- **Objective:**  
  Photograph fish underwater by deploying a specialized camera rig on a pole.

- **Mechanics:**  
  - The player becomes stationary, anchoring themselves in place.  
  - The **camera rig** is lowered into the water via rod and line.  
  - Use the **arrow keys** to rotate and aim the camera underwater, with standard wildlife photography left-right cone and altitude bar.
  - Fish only appear when the camera is fully submerged, and each species has unique behaviors and movement patterns.  
  - Stealth and timing are key—photographing rare or fast-moving fish requires precision and patience.

- **Upgrades:**  
  - **Camera Clarity:** Improves visibility and resolution underwater.  

- **Special Event:**  
  - **Eco Survey Missions:** Collaborate with in-game researchers to catalog species for rewards. See Wildlife Researcher for more details.

### 3. **Lockpicking in Abandoned Buildings** 🔐🏚️🧰  
- **Objective:**  
  When you bought the mountain, you inherited a mess of **abandoned structures**—old **lift shacks**, **research stations**, even a few **ranger outposts**. They’re locked tight, but now they’re yours to crack.  
  Break into **doors**, **safes**, and **tool lockers** to uncover 🔦 **mid-mountain hideouts**, 💎 **hidden gear**, and 📖 **long-buried lore** from those who came before.

---

- **🔧 Mechanics:**  
  - **Initiated at locked interactables** found across old buildings and icy outposts.  
  - Gameplay uses a **dual-input system**:  
    - One hand applies **rotational tension** (like a wrench),  
    - The other manipulates a **lock pick** across a row of **virtual tumblers**.  
  - Each lock is **procedurally generated**:  
    - Randomized **pin positions**,  
    - Varying **resistance thresholds**,  
    - And different **feedback styles**—listen for **clicks**, feel for **wiggles**, watch for **HUD shivers**.  
  - **Hold tension steady**—apply too much or too little and you’ll **reset all unset pins**.  
  - Higher-tier locks introduce:
    - 🌀 **False sets** (feel real but drop later),  
    - 🔄 **Multi-stage tumblers**,  
  - **Failing** too many times can result in a **broken pick**

---

- **🛠️ Upgrades:**  
  - 🪛 **Precision Picks** – Smoother glide, better feedback on tough pins.  
  - ✋ **Grip Master Tensioner** – Wider “sweet spot,” more forgiving tension range.  
  - 🔇 **Stealth Kit** – Allows you to approch wildlife closer before spooking them. 

---

- **⚠️ Risks & Challenge:**  
  - **Pick durability** breaks with poor technique—snap a pick and you’re done unless you’ve got backups.  
  - 🥶 **Bad Weather** increases pick wobble and slows hand speed—bring gloves or warm up first.  

> *“Every lock sings its own little tune. You gotta wiggle your tools to the pins’ rhythm, feel that spring under your fingertips… and hope there isn’t a snarlin’ catamount lurking just past the door.”* – *Tinkerer Maxi*

### 4. 🧠 **Deep Diggin’**

SledHEAD has a wealth of history, much of which is buried under the snow and ice. Use your new Panttock (a combination of the earth moving, rock picking mattock and a river-sloshing gold pan) to unearth buried treasure, prospect for raw unrefined wealth, and calcified history in the form of cryptid fossils.

#### 🪙 Shovelin' **Dig Spots** (Soft Earth)

- Hidden beneath snow or in barely-noticeable terrain features.
- Yield: **Treasure** and **Fossils**
- Locations: Anything diggable (Snow, dirt, etc).
- **Risk:** None—just the chance of digging up nothing or low-value junk if you pick poorly.
- **Upgrades:**

- **Upgrades:**
  - Increased visibility
  - More efficient tool = less stamina/time spent

---

#### 🌊 **Panning in Rivers**

- Can be done in *any* flowing water on the mountain.
- Yield: **All four types**, in **tiny bits**
- Locations: Anything pannable (Rivers, Streams, etc.)
- **Risk:** None at all—just slow returns if you’re in a low-yield stream or not upgraded.
- **Upgrades:**
  - More efficient tool = less stamina/time spent

#### 👧 **Minnie – The Convenience Store Owner**

Minnie runs the cozy little convenience store nestled near the trailhead and base camp. She grew up on this mountain—sledding it, hiking it, panning its rivers, and listening to every wild tale folks whispered around campfires. Prospecting tools, backpacks, river pans, rods, bait? She’s got ‘em.She even has a slightly marked up "Everything Else" shelf! But more importantly, by the door sits an eye-catching **rack of Legendary Lenses**, there to tempt curious adventurers to part with their own treasure.

**Role:** Starting point and upgrade hub for all things Treasure, Prospecting, Panning, and Fossil gear. She sells you your Panttock, as well as upgrades it.

**Vibe:** Understated expert with sharp instincts and a dry wit. She knows this mountain like her own reflection, but she won’t spoon-feed you the secrets. That’s the fun part.

### 5. **Kite Flying** 🪁🌬️🎶  
#### - #### **Objective:**  
  Take to the skies during **uphill climbs** with a trusty kite, using wind and rhythm to lift you to new heights—literally. Your kite’s more than a toy—it’s a tool for discovery, glide-based trickery, and unlocking secrets only visible from above.  
  Master the flow, and you’ll earn ✨ **airborne bonuses**, and 🪁 **flight-only shortcuts**.

---

#### - **🎮 Mechanics:**  
#####   - **Uphill Phase:**  
    - Control your kite using a **music-style rhythm system**—directional prompts appear like notes in a jam session.  
    - Nail the beat to stabilize, catch wind currents, and **ride the thermals like a verse you wrote yourself**.  
    - Botch the timing and your kite’ll flutter down like Jay after a particularly mellow afternoon.  

#####   - **Downhill Phase:**  
    - Your kite becomes a **glider**, extending airtime.  
    - Different kite types offer different styles—agile kites offer greater control, larger ones will fly further, aerogel kites are heat resistant, bubble "kites" hold extra air underwater and in vacuum!  

---

#### - **🛠️ Kites & Upgrades:**  
  Your kite *is* your upgrade. Each one offers a unique feel, function, and flair based on the environment or your playstyle:

  - 🪁 **Jay’s First Kite** – A balanced, starter-friendly glider. Good control and decent airtime. Fades to red in stormlight.  
  - 🌀 **Windwhip** – Lightweight and ultra-agile. Perfect for trick runs. Loses distance in strong wind.  
  - 🏄 **Stormkite** – Reinforced rigging and heavy fabric. Handles extreme gusts and lightning zones. Tricky to steer.  
  - 🔥 **Aerogel Wing** – Heat-resistant and stable. Soars over volcanic vents and desert thermals. Heavy and slow to lift.  
  - 🫧 **Bubbleknot** – Sealed, floaty "kite" that holds breathable air. Works underwater and in thin-atmosphere zones. Nearly useless in regular air.  
  - 🌕 **Lunarch** – Ultra-wide, low-gravity sail designed for thin-air, nighttime, or vacuum mountain regions. Poor steering but massive airtime.  

> *“I always say... a kite's like a muician: some are meant to dance, some are meant to sing, and some wanna get higher.”* – Jay


---

#### - **🎯 Special Events & Bonuses:**  
  - ⚡ **Storm Riding** – Extreme winds = extreme lift. Ride lightning skies for massive trick bonuses.
  - 🎒 **Floating Loot Drops** – Balloons with loot attached to them sometimes float by - use your kite to pop the balloon and collect the fallen goods!

You can keep the timer resetting by performing more tricks with different fans on screen down hill of the first group.  
  - 🏁 **Trick Zones** – Areas hand-built for massive stunts and flowing chains.  

---

- **⚠️ Risks & Challenge:**  
  - ❌ **Crash Penalty** – Lose your combo and gear durability if you biff it.  
  - 🌀 **Over-rotation & Drift** – Bad inputs can throw your whole landing outta whack.  

---

- **🏔️ NPC: Jake – Sledboarding Pioneer, Trick Philosopher, and Builder of Mountains**  
  - Jake is a legend not just for what he rode, but for what he *built*.  
  - He is a sledboarding pioneer and carved out the first trick zones by hand. These days, he’s the one who constructs what others only imagine—rails, ramps, photo decks, and even lift stations. If something works up here, it’s because Jake made it strong enough to hold.  
  - Off the slope, he’s a quiet carpenter who works in a small shed tucked into a windbreak of trees. But if you’re worthy, he’ll show you how to move like the mountain’s listening. He knows every move in the book - he invented most of 'em!

> *“Style isn’t flash. It’s control without shouting.”*  
> *“Every trick begins before you leave the ground. Every landing finishes long after you hit it.”*  
> *“Balance is a kind of listening.”*  
> *“What you build reflects what you believe. So build things that last.”*  
> *“You think sleddin’s about winnin’? Nah. It’s about wakin’. Every carve, every crash, every laugh—it’s code. You were speakin’ the language of the universe, and it finally heard ya. Now go… Dream bigger.”*

### 10. 🐝 **Beekeeping**

The mountain is alive with more than just snow and treasure—hidden in trees, under ledges, and tucked along sun-warmed ridgelines are **wild mountain hives**, buzzing with activity and potential. As a beekeeper, you’ll locate these elusive hives, carefully collect precious **wax, honey, and royal jelly**, and even guide new hives to safer, more productive spots.

#### 🐾 **Finding Hives**

- Hives are **hidden in natural terrain** like trees and rock hollows.
- Appear faintly or not at all without proper tools or lens support.
- Use the **🐝 Wax Lens** to have greater visibility for bee lining.

#### 🧭 **Bee Lining: Tracking the Wild Hive**

- Start by spotting foraging bees at flower patches or bait stations (a mix of honey and sugar water).
- Trap a few in a **bee box**—a small wooden box with a viewing window.
- Let them feed, then release them one at a time and **track their flight path**.
- Repeat from several spots to triangulate the location of a wild hive—usually tucked inside a hollow tree.

#### 👑 Getting the Queen:

Attempt a **cutout**:

- Calm bees with smokers before approaching.
- Use an **axe** to carefully open the hive location.
- Watch bee behavior to locate the queen—she’s usually surrounded by a tight cluster.
- Gently capture her using a **queen clip or cage**.
- Transfer her with several combs and workers into a new hive box, starting a new domestic hive back at base.
- Use a **collection kit** to extract wax, honey, or queen pheromones.

#### 🎒 **Harvest Rewards**

- **Honey:** Used for energy restoration and temporary power-ups.
- **Wax:** Used to make your sled go faster.
- **Royal Jelly:** Rare drop—quite valuable!

#### 🔧 **Upgrades**

Most gear is available through **Pete the Beekeeper**, the mountain's laid-back buzz-buddy who talks to bees more than people and swears by the calming power of fresh pine smoke:

- **Smokers –** calms bees before harvest or queen capture
- **Hive Boxes –** used for relocating and domesticating wild colonies
- **Axes –** for felling trees and carefully cutting into hive trees during a cutout
- **Bee Boxes –** for trapping and tracking forager bees during bee lining
- **Bee Breeding –** breed your bees to get other, exotic species of bee that produces even more incredible honey (think Frost Bees and Fire Bees for example)

#### 📍 **Exploration Loop**

- Wander the wilds.
- Watch for visual or audio signs of bee activity.
- Equip the Wax Lens to make it easier to see migrating bees.
- Carefully harvest  hives.
- Return materials to base or use them in crafting.

#### 🧑‍🌾 **Pete the Beekeeper**

Known to locals as **"Encyclopedia Pete"**, this seasoned mountain man has spent a lifetime logging, beekeeping, and learnin’ every sound this mountain makes. Pete lives at the bottom of the mountain in a cabin that hums—literally—with hive boxes built into the siding and axes lined up just as neatly. His days are split between tending wild hives and felling trees, and he’ll gladly sell you the tools to do both—**axes, wax kits, and bee gear included**. Pete teaches new beekeepers how to spot wild hives, so they can follow the path of the apiarist.

**Role:** Source of gear, upgrades, and wisdom for the **Wild Hive Beekeeping** minigame and tree felling. Offers beekeeping tools like smokers and hives, and axes.

**Vibe:** Old Vermont soul with a dry wit and deep roots. Talks slow, moves slower, but knows more about the mountain than anyone else alive. Always smells faintly of oak, smoke, and honey.

### 11. Wood Chopping 🌲🪓   
> *“Bees don’t bother nobody who minds their manners. Same goes for trees, mostly.”* – Pete the Beekeeper

---

#### 🎯 **Objective**
Fell trees during the **Uphill Phase** to create **temporary downhill shortcuts** and gather **wood for crafting**.  
But watch it, bud—trees don’t grow back on command. **Chop too many**, and you’ll change the mountain in ways ya might regret. 🌲💔

---

#### ⚙️ **Mechanics**

##### 🌳 **Interactable Trees**  
Trees can be chopped, felling them and clearing the way.

##### ⏱️ **Mini-Game**  
Chopping triggers a **timed input challenge**, like **Kite Flying** 🎯.

##### 🪓 **Tools Needed**  
You’ll need an **Axe**, buyable from **Minnie** or **Pete**, and **upgradable** for speed, reach, or yield.

##### 💪 **Stamina Cost**  
Every chop uses **stamina**, so you’ll need to **weigh your options** carefully on the climb.

---

#### 🎁 **Results & Benefits**

##### 🛷 **Trailblazing**
- Chopped trees **open up smoother sled routes**, create drop-ins, or reveal hidden ramps.  
- Trails last until regrowth—could be **days, hours, or a surprise snowstorm** 🌨️.

##### 🪵 **Resource Gathering**
- Felled trees drop **wood**, used for **crafting furniture, upgrades, signs**, or even **building cozy structures at home**.  
- Higher-tier trees may offer **unique lumber** for rare blueprints.

---

#### 🌱 **Natural Regrowth System**

- Trees regrow **naturally and randomly** over time based on **elevation, weather**, and how many are still standing nearby.
- A **dynamic forest balance system** tracks how “healthy” a region is:

  - ✅ Clear a small patch = regrowth likely  
  - ❌ Chop everything = growth slows or stops entirely (and the birds stop singin’ too 🐦💔)

---

#### 🌿 **Saplings and Growth Stages**

- Chopped areas might sprout **baby trees** that can’t be chopped (yet).  
- **Mature trees** offer full benefits—but ya gotta wait, or help ‘em along with upgrades. 🌱➡️🌲

---

#### 🔧 **Upgrades & Systems**

| 🔨 **Upgrade**         | 🎯 **Effect**                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🪓 Sharpened Axe       | Faster chops, lower stamina use.                                             |
| 🌿 Reforester's Charm  | Slightly increases tree regrowth speed in surrounding areas.                 |

---

#### ⚠️ **Risks & Strategy**

- Chop too many trees and you'll risk **barren slopes**—no shortcuts, no wood, no wildlife. 🚫🌲  
- Animals **avoid over-cleared areas**, affecting your **photo score** 📸🐾  
- Trees may **grow into trails** if neglected, **blocking shortcuts**. 😬

#### 🧑‍🌲 **Pete the Beekeeper (and Woodsman)**  
Pete ain’t just the guy buzzin’ about bees—he’s been **felling timber** since before you were knee-high in powder. ❄️🪓  
Around these parts, folks say **Pete knows every tree by name**, and every stump by its story. It's why they call him **Encyclopedia Pete**.

He lives at the **edge of the tree line** in a cabin stacked with **firewood, handmade tools**, and **axes sharp enough to split a sneeze**.  
While he’s the one who’ll sell you your **first axe** and teach you how to swing it true, he’s also the first to **warn you not to take more than the mountain gives**.

---

##### 🍽️ **AVM Menu (Auto-Vended Food Items)**

These ready-to-eat items are available at any stocked AVM:

- ☕ **Hot & Iced Cocoa** – Warmth or cool boost, and stamina boost. Made from local milk and Aria’s family’s Smooth Chocorator fudge—melted into creamy perfection and topped with a cloud of homemade marshmallows. The cocoa tastes like childhood winters, first chairlift rides, and everything good about coming in from the cold. The AVMs only make 2 versions, and the Smooth Chocorator fudge version is one for some reason. Aria doesn’t ask why, but she'll gladly make you a "cocoa" herself from any of the other 11 flavors of fudge she sells.
- ☕ **Hot & Iced Coffee** – Warmth or cool boost, and  speed boost. Brewed from beans roasted right here at the hotel—by Aria herself. On roasting days, the whole mountain smells like a cuppa joe. She grinds fresh for guests and morning service, but the AVMs insist on getting the beans whole. “They like it that way; won't take 'em pre-ground” she says. And somehow, they still serve it hot or iced, ground and brewed to order.
- ☕ **Hot & Iced Mocha** – Warmth or cool boost, and minor speed & stamina boost. Rich, chocolaty-smooth, and deeply caffeinated. This mocha is born from Aria’s Turkish Mocha Delight fudge—an intense mix of fine Turkish-ground coffee, dutched cocoa, and generations of family flavor science. Melted into locally-sourced milk and served hot or iced, it’s the only other cocoa variant the AVMs accept. She doesn’t argue. She just restocks.
- 🧊 **Sugar on Snow** – Light stamina regen. Straight from the trail to your tastebuds. This is the exact same simple recipe Aria’s great-aunt used to sell at roadside stands. The syrup used in this mountain classic was tapped, bottled, and sold by you, then automagically caramelized over snow inside the AVM. Don’t think about it too hard—just grab one before it melts.
- 🥒 **Pickled** **Habanero &** **Dill Sour Cucumber Pickle** – Portable stamina regen & warmth boost wrapped in a briny, nose-tinglin’ snap. Made with the same **fiery habaneros** from Aria’s Cowboy Candy but spun into a **dill-forward sour cucumber pickle** that clears your sinuses and jump-starts your core. Not sweet, not subtle—just crisp, bold, and more than a little warming.
- **🥒 Homestyle Spice & Everything Nice Sweet Cucumber Pickle** – Cool boost & stamina regen wrapped in an allspice-sweet, clove-kissed crunch. Originally developed as a **fudge flavoring for a pickle festival contest**, Aria repurposed the family’s legendary "Homestyle Spice & Everything Nice" blend into these soothing **sweet pickles**.
- 🍕 **Personal Cowboy Candy & 3 Cheese Pizza** – High stamina restore & regen featuring **homemade Mozzarella & Feta** Cheeses from local milk, a locally **Vermont-made aged Cheddar** cheese, and the same homemade spicy **Blazing Bull Habanero Edition Cowboy Candy** sold in mason jars at the Vermont Homestyle Hotel Gift Shop (Aria also offers a Mutton Buster Mild Cubanelle edition and the Original Signature Jalapeno Edition, but the AVMs won't take 'em). You gotta **eat 'em hot** to really **enjoy 'em** proper-like.

> AVMs **only accept raw ingredients**—players must supply salt, cucumbers, milk, flour, and more from Aria’s kitchen. They do seem to gather their own filtered ice and water at least.

---

##### 🎤 **Personality & Vibe**

Aria’s got **red hair, freckles, and hustle baked into her bones**. She’s **young**, sweet, and **focused as heck**. Whether she’s flipping pancakes, refilling towel warmers, or managing a tourism rush mid-storm—**she handles it with a smile and a spatula**.

She’s a distant cousin of the player, and she lets ya know it—always with a warm *“Hiya, Cuz!”* before handing you something hot and comforting. She’d restock the AVMs herself if she could, but that’d mean closing the hotel, and **this girl doesn’t believe in shutting down**.

Aria is also a seriously skilled cook—her recipes (like those legendary smoked jalapeño wontons and secret family blond brownies) are known across the slopes. Just don’t ask how the AVMs turn raw ingredients into pizza. Not even the Tinkerer knows. Nobody even can change their recipes... at least on this mountain.

> *“Can’t land a triple cork with an empty belly.”*\
> *“Hospitality is just high-speed logistics in an apron.”*\
> *“The secret to hotel management? Don’t stop movin’, ‘til everyone’s smilin’, sleepin' or fed. Sometimes all three.”*\

> *"Yeah, the sap takes a while to thicken up, but I've got a big solar-oven."*

##### 🎤 **Personality & Vibe**
Minnie’s not flashy, and she’s not out there trickin’ off glaciers—but she *is* the one who sold gear to the guy who did. She’s the kind of local who’s been here forever, never left, and doesn’t *need* to prove it. You ask for rope and she hands you one tied in seven useful knots. You ask for directions, and she gives you a story and a trail riddle.  

She respects the mountain the same way she respects her shelves—kept sharp, kept stocked, and always slightly dusty with mystery. Practical, direct, and not too interested in your excuses—Minnie gives you **what you earn**, not what you ask for.

##### 🎤 **Personality & Vibe**
Minnie grew up on this mountain—sledding it, climbing it, digging holes in it, and *listening to it*. She's got a dry wit, a sharp eye, and the uncanny ability to sell you exactly what you didn’t know you needed.  

She’s not flashy—she’s **solid**. A quiet legend in her own right, always organizing gear, scribblin’ in ledgers, and somehow knowing exactly when someone’s gonna walk in needing a **wax lens and two baits before sundown**.

> *“If it looks like junk, dig anyway. This mountain hides her best stuff under the worst rocks.”*  
> *“The river don’t care what you’re hopin’ to find—but it’ll show you what you need.”*

##### 🎤 **Personality & Vibe**

Maxi doesn’t *ride* sleds—she engineers them, *pilots* them, and sometimes makes 'em dance to her rhythm. With rainbow glasses and a soldering iron in-hand, she’s the reason Micro Mountain’s pint-sized courses even function—her RC sleds are tiny, turbo-charged miracles. She didn’t build Bitstream Bluffs, but she’s the first to find it, solder it, and she hasn't had any magic smoke escape yet!

Her lift shack-turned-lab is a mess of wires, blinking lights, and half-finished blueprints, but she knows where *everything* is. If it beeps, zaps, or locks shut, Maxi’s already rebuilt it twice—and the new version makes toast. To her, the mountain is one big circuit board, and you’re just another spark lookin’ for ground.

She’s young, with a sharp grin and sharper tools, thick hair up in bright rainbow pigtails, and boots that look like they’ve seen every kind of weather and wiring job. Her gloves are fingerless, her hoodie is well-patched from solder burns, her skirt is a kaleidoscope of color, and there’s almost always something blinking or buzzing quietly in her pocket. Her rainbow lenses flash like signal lights, and when she starts talking tech, it’s like listening to lightning figure itself out.

> *"Bitstream’s not broken. It’s just... dreaming."*  \
> *"Locks are just puzzles with a guaranteed solution."*\
> *“I didn’t break the lock. I simply unlocked permanently.”*  \

## 🏔️ **Mountain Themes & Progression**

### 🐫 Pyramid Peak 🏜️📿

- **Description:**\
  When the snow melts and sledding season shuts down back home, thrill-seekers head to **Pyramid Peak**—a sun-scorched dune mountain crowned by ancient ruins. Despite its name, the real sledding happens not on the pyramid itself, but on the **colossal sand dune beside it**, which towers high enough to catch the desert wind. From the summit, you can spot a single, distant pyramid silhouetted against the orange horizon.

- **Gameplay Rules:**

  - You ride your regular sled, but you’ll need **Sandrunner Skis** to traverse shifting dunes and loose terrain.
  - You can **pan the sand anywhere**—this mountain is a prospector’s dream.
  - Home to two distinct bee species:
    - 🐝 Dust Bees build **sand-hives along dune ridges**, harvesting **drift-pollen**—airborne **grains from flowers** carried in by **seasonal winds** and crushed into **fine powder** by the shifting sands. Their honey’s sweet, delicate, **powdery, and nearly weightless**.
    - 🐝 Desert Bees, fondly nicknamed **Dessert Bees**, live in **sandstone and honey-daub hives**. Their cactus flower honey is so rich and naturally sweet, it’s a **signature ingredient** in **Aria’s Baklava**—and a favorite among **high-end chefs** across the globe.

- **Mechanics:**

  - **Sandstorms & Hidden Pitfalls:** Impede vision and open sudden trick paths or buried ruins.
  - **Tumble Hazards:** Falling boulders and crumbling ledges require quick reactions.
  - **Solar Intensity Zones:** Overheating risk unless cooled by shade or fan-supplied gear.

- **Special Features:**

  - 🏜️ **All-Sand Panning:** Every grain might hide treasure—gleaming gems, ancient relics, or bee-built artifacts.

### 🔮 Crystal Cavern 🌌💎

- **Description:**\
  Deep inside the **starter mountain** lies the shimmering, subterranean realm of **Crystal Cavern**. This sparkling maze of glowing crystal formations and slick mineral walls is **only accessible via Deep Diggin'** or hidden cave entrances. It’s the only mountain zone with **enhanced Pickin’**, and the home of the mysterious **Crystal Bees**.

- **Gameplay Rules:**

  - The cavern’s icy floor requires precision sledding and careful control.
  - The **Crystal Bees** here don’t make edible honey—instead, they excrete a mineral-laced resin that hardens into diamond-grade hive walls.

### 🐜 Micro Mountain 🌱🔬

- **Description:**\
  Nestled in the humid glow of Pete’s greenhouse apiary, **Micro Mountain** is no illusion—it’s a living moss-covered mountain **scaled to a micro-drone sled** you’ll pilot using your **familiar RC Sled controls**.\
  What looks like a few stones and some terrarium glass from outside becomes a towering jungle of dew-covered leaves, tumbling ant tunnels, pollen avalanches, and clover-blade cliffs when you’re on the inside.

  It’s a **true miniature mountain**, and  **it never changes**—at least, not on its own...

- **Gameplay Rules:**

  - You ride a **Micro Sled**, a tiny physical drone which happens to match your RC sled’s handling exactly.
  - None of your standard sled gear applies here—**only your RC Sled upgrades** (like handling, drift control, battery tuning, and precision kits) affect performance.
  - Runs require **both a high RC Sledding and Beekeeping level** to unlock. Pete won’t let just anyone drive near his queens.
  - You must **produce Royal Jelly Wax** and apply it to the sled’s micro-runners before each session—it’s the only way to glide through the dense, clumpy moss.

- **Mechanics:**

  - **Garden-Scale Hazards:**
    - Rolling **dew droplets** can  or sweep you away.
    - **Pollen dust clouds** choke visibility during flower bloom cycles.
  - **Environmental Dynamics:**
    - **Bees** Pete cares for in the larger greenhouse will influence what appears in Micro Mountain.
    - Breed a new species? The micro-world might gain **new terrain, behavior changes, or rare hazards**.
  - **Hydration Events:**
    - Sprinklers above the terrarium trigger **weather patterns**, soaking moss into slick slides or flooding trails temporarily.

- **Special Features:**

  - 🧪 **Persistent Layout:** Micro Mountain never changes randomly—but it **evolves** based on your actions in the real world.
  - 🐝 **Bee Influence System:**
    - Introduce new bees to Pete’s hives? Expect new pollen types, tunnel behaviors, or even **insect allies** to show up in your micro-runs.
  - 🕳️ **Tunnels & Trail Switches:** Secret wormholes and ant-dug paths allow for run routing choices—risky but rewarding.

- **Power-Up Requirement:**\
  🍯 **Royal Jelly Wax**\
  *A high-efficiency nano-wax derived from rare bees. Applied to the runners of the Micro Sled before entry. Greatly reduces friction on organic terrain (moss, bark, clover). May attract bees.*

- **Pete’s Warning:**

  > “Ya want to sled near my bees, ya’d best learn to *respect* ‘em first. That wax you’re glidin’ on? Took twenty drones a week to make it. Don’t waste it on showboatin’.”

- **Lore Hook:**\
  Pete built Micro Mountain years ago to study pollination routes in miniature. But when he saw a bee riding a dew drop down a moss slide, he got an idea.\
  He fitted a micro drone with a handy control harness and started testin’.\
  Now? It’s your turn. But only if Pete thinks you’re ready—**and the bees agree**.\
  Just remember: in here, **you’re not the apex predator**. You’re just another bug tryin’ to ride the slope.

### 💻 Bitstream Bluffs 🔮📶

> *“It’s not alive... just ones and zeros. But then... isn’t DNA the same trick, but in a zip file?”* – Tinkerer Maxi

#### 🏔️ Description

Bitstream Bluffs ain’t on any map—'cause it ain’t real. It’s a fully-virtual **digital mountain**, accessed through a glitchy old **arcade cabinet** you can install at your lodge.\
You don’t ride your usual sled here. Instead, you pilot a **digital proxy sled**, using the **exact same control layout and responsiveness** as your RC Sled. Spooky? Or lucky?

**Your skills carry over—but none of your gear does.** This isn’t a joyride—it’s **a simulation carved in code**..

#### 🕹️ Gameplay Rules

- You ride a **Digital Sled**, rendered entirely in a simulated world.
- It **feels just like your RC Sled**—same physics tuning, control setup, and handling style.
- No sled mods or limited inventory apply—this is a **skill-focused simulation** with randomized hazards.
- You start near the peak, and the **slopes never end**. There is no up, only down. **There is no climb, only carve.**
- Every session is a **procedural remix**, offering new glitch patterns, track shapes, hazards, and gravity rules.
- The **terrain integrates features from every mountain you’ve unlocked**—snowbanks from Garbage Glacier, dune-launch thermals from Pyramid Peak, or bubble-path airtime chains from Underwater Mountain.

#### 🔧 Mechanics

- **Glitch Zones & Malware Hazards:** Scramble vision, invert terrain, or randomize momentary movement.
- **Bit Bridges & Datastream Trails:** High-speed trails through corrupted memory sectors.
- **Firewall Gates:** Fry control stability unless avoided or properly timed.
- **Packet Winds:** Buffering data gusts that can lag you—or crash you—into digital space.
- **Bitstream Drift:** Anti-grav momentum puzzles that test your sled finesse.

#### ⭐ Special Features

- 🕹️ **Arcade Access:** Requires unlocking the **Bitstream Cabinet** and installing it at home.
- 🔁 **Ever-Shifting Layouts:** Glitches rewrite the mountain on every entry—no two runs are alike.
- 📼 **Daily Patch Cycles:** Each real-world day downloads new terrain permutations, visual filters, and challenge rules.\
  Examples: *Upside-Down Mode*, *No Jumping Allowed*, *One-Life Turbo Run*.
- 🌐 **Resonance Echoing:** The more you sled Bitstream Bluffs, the more “in tune” it becomes with your style—future sessions might resemble your past runs, *as if the mountain is remembering you*.

#### 💾 Power-Up

**Error Correction Engine**\
*Prevents crashes from glitch walls, corrects brief input corruption, and adds a buffer against malware trail effects.*

#### 🛠️ Tinkerer’s Tip

> *“It ain’t your RC sled... but it should **feel** like it is. Whoever made it mirrored the controls perfectly, down to the frame... what are the odds?”*

#### 🌀 Lore Hook

Nobody knows where the cabinet came from. The Tinkerer Maxi swears she found it buzzing in a field, half-buried, still warm.\
It updates itself. It runs, whether you plug it in or not. Maybe plug it in though - I think it likes the buzzing.\
The leaderboard refreshes hourly. Sometimes... it knows your name.

Some say it's just a ghost in the machine.\
Others say it’s a window—**a way to sled somewhere else**.\
Somewhere deeper. Older.

Whatever it is...\
it’s waiting.\
And it **wants** to be sledded.

###  Vertigo Vents 🌋💨

- **Description:**  
  Sizzling volcanic slopes with flowing lava rivers, steaming geysers, and jagged obsidian cliffs. This is **trickster paradise**, where the heat is deadly, but the **airtime is divine**. Volcanic vents blast you sky-high, turning every ramp into a launchpad for mid-air madness.

- **Mechanics:**  
  - **Heat Meter:** Stay in the hot zones too long and you’ll fry—seek out sled-mounted **cooling tanks**.  
  - **Ash Clouds:** Sudden visibility loss forces quick reaction sledding.  
  - **Geothermal Geysers:** Act as **natural trick boosters**, launching you for combos and big air.  
  - **Vulcanic Wind Corridors:** Let you chain even more tricks for **massive multipliers**.  

- **Special Feature:**  
  - **Style Zones:** Naturally occurring lava halfpipes and vent blasts set up prime trick sequences.  
  - **Eruption Events:** Mid-run eruptions can end your run early at best, and rack up a significant rescue bill at the worst.

- **Power-Up:**  
  🔥 **Heat Shielding Sled Coating**  
  *Required to enter. Shields your sled from burn damage and slightly improves glide friction across all terrain. Upgrading it will keep you from melting longer.*

- **Jake’s Comment:**  
  > “You only *think* you’ve hit max airtime—wait till the mountain spits fire under you.”

🔄 Infinite Upgrades with Soft Caps
===================================

**Expanding Progression Without Breaking Balance**

Currently, upgrades in **SledHEAD** have **hard caps**, limiting how many times they can be purchased. While this provides structure, it **restricts long-term progression** and prevents **emergent playstyles** from evolving over multiple runs. To keep **each run fresh and engaging**, we're shifting to an **infinite upgrade system** with **diminishing returns** beyond a **soft cap** for
**Personal Upgrades**. **Mountain Upgrades** will
need to be rebought for each new mountain purchased, and
may or may not be infinite as appropriate to the upgrade.

🎯 Proposed Solution
--------------------

-   **All upgrades become infinitely upgradable.**
-   Each upgrade **retains its effectiveness early on** but **scales down gradually** beyond a set level.
-   **Soft caps vary** depending on the upgrade type:
    -   **Speed upgrades** could start diminishing at **Level 10**.
    -   **Trick bonuses** could scale freely until **Level 20** before slowing down.
-   **Mathematical balancing** ensures that upgrades remain **meaningful** but **don't become overpowered**.

📊 Scaling Formula: Exponential & Logarithmic Decay
---------------------------------------------------

Instead of **linear scaling** (e.g., "+1 Speed per level"), we use **diminishing returns** to keep upgrades valuable without breaking balance.

### ✏ Formula Example:

newValue = baseValue + (scalingFactor * sqrt(level))

-   **Early levels feel impactful**, allowing noticeable improvements.
-   **Later levels slow down naturally**, preventing infinite stacking from making players overpowered.
-   Works across **various upgrade types**, from **speed boosts to trick multipliers**.

🔎 **Alternative Approach: Logarithmic Scaling**\
For upgrades that should scale *aggressively early on* but taper off smoothly:

newValue = baseValue * (1 + (scalingFactor * log(level + 1)))

-   Great for upgrades like **boost charge rates or sled handling**, where a **big early impact** makes sense but **total mastery should be gradual**.

✅ Benefits of Infinite Upgrades with Soft Caps
----------------------------------------------

✔ **Keeps long-term progression engaging** -- No artificial "max level" bottleneck.\
✔ **Encourages specialized strategies** -- Players can **focus on speed, tricks, or economy-based builds**.\
✔ **Prevents upgrade obsolescence** -- Players **always have something meaningful to invest in**.\
✔ **Maintains challenge balance** -- Runs become **progressively stronger**, but not infinitely easy.

📌 Tasks & Implementation Plan
------------------------------

-   [ ]  **Remove hard upgrade caps** for all current upgrades.
-   [ ]  **Implement soft cap mechanics** using **square root or logarithmic scaling**.
-   [ ]  **Fine-tune soft cap levels** for different upgrade categories (e.g., Speed vs. Trick Boosts).
-   [ ]  **Balance test progression** to ensure **long-term upgrades stay meaningful but not overpowered**.

This system ensures **players always have room to grow**, while keeping **SledHEAD's challenge intact**. 🚀🔥
