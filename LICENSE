# SledHEAD Dual License Agreement
**Version 1.0 – March 2025**  

This License Agreement applies to SledHEAD (the "Game"), including its source code and assets, created by the original author **Marvin Bentley II** ("Licensor"). By copying, modifying, distributing, or otherwise using the Game or any of its components, you (the "Licensee") agree to the following terms:

---

## 1. Definitions

- **"Source Code"**: The software code of the Game, including all scripts, programs, and software files intended to produce the Game’s functionality.
- **"Assets"**: All non-code content in the Game, including but not limited to artwork, images, textures, models, sprites, music, sound effects, voice, dialogue, level designs, animations, and any other audiovisual or creative works included with the Game.
- **"Mod" or "Modification"**: Any derivative work that is based on or uses any portion of the Game’s Source Code or Assets, including add-ons, plugins, expansions, or fan-made content that extends or alters the Game.
- **"Commercial Use"**: Use of the Game or its components that is intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.  
  _(For clarity: selling the Game or Mods, charging money for access to the Game or Mods, or monetizing the Game’s Assets as standalone products are considered Commercial Use. However, monetization of gameplay videos/streams is addressed separately in Section 4.)_
- **"You" (or "Licensee")**: Any individual or legal entity exercising the rights granted by this License (for example, a player, developer, or modder who uses the Game or its content).
- **"Licensor"**: The original author and copyright holder of SledHEAD.

## 2. Open Source License for Source Code

The Source Code of SledHEAD is licensed to you under the terms of the **GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 (AGPLv3)**, or (at your option) any later version of the AGPL published by the Free Software Foundation. This means:

- You may **use, study, copy, modify, and distribute** the Source Code freely, provided you comply with the AGPLv3 terms.  
  - **If you distribute your modified version of the Source Code or make it available for use over a network** (e.g., running a modified game server for others to play), **you must make your Source Code modifications publicly available** under the same license (AGPLv3).
- The full text of the AGPLv3 is provided along with this agreement (usually in a file named `AGPL-3.0.txt` or similar). By accepting this License, you agree to abide by the conditions of AGPLv3 for the Game’s Source Code.
- **No Additional Restrictions on Source Code**:  
  Except as expressly stated in this Agreement, you **may not impose any further restrictions** on the exercise of the rights granted under the AGPLv3 for the Source Code. _(In other words, the Source Code remains free and open under AGPLv3 terms whenever it is distributed or deployed, unless a separate Commercial License is obtained as described in Section 6.)_

## 4. Permission for Videos, Streaming, and Screenshots

The Licensor **explicitly grants permission** to capture, use, and share audiovisual content from the Game, including gameplay videos, streams, screenshots, and similar content, **even if monetized**, as long as:

- Monetized streaming on platforms like **Twitch, YouTube, etc.** is explicitly **allowed** and is **not considered Commercial Use** under this License.
- You **do not need permission** to create Let’s Play videos, reviews, or live streams of SledHEAD.

This permission **does not** grant you the right to extract Assets for separate use in other commercial products.

---

## 5. Attribution Requirement

Whenever you distribute or publicly use the Game, you **must** provide attribution to the original author _(Licensor)_. The attribution should be placed appropriately, such as:

- If distributing the Game unmodified: Retain the original credits.

## 6. Modding and Derivative Works

SledHEAD is **mod-friendly** under the following conditions:
