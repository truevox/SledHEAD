# üìç **SledHEAD Comprehensive Development Roadmap**

This document outlines the detailed path from the current implementation to the complete "1.0" version of **SledHEAD**, including the critical gameplay shift to an **Up-Then-Down** stamina-based mechanic.

---

## üéØ Core Directional Change: Up-Then-Down Gameplay Loop
- Players start at the mountain's base, managing stamina as they climb upward.
- Strategic decision-making to sled down for rewards before stamina depletion.
- Higher altitudes host rare wildlife, higher rewards, and greater risks.

---

## üåç Procedural World & Persistence
- Procedural terrain generation (rocks, ramps, obstacles).
- Consistent world state within each playthrough.
- Seed-based mountain generation system for replayability.
- Dynamic NPC and wildlife positioning per session.

---

## üé¢ Gameplay Loops
### Uphill Phase (Climbing & Exploration)
- Stamina management critical for movement.
- Consumables and resting points for stamina recovery.
- Wildlife photography as main uphill activity.
- Shortcuts and hidden paths unlockable via exploration.

### Downhill Phase (High-Speed Sledding)
- Perform tricks, avoid obstacles, and earn cash.
- Combo trick chains for bonus multipliers.
- Time trials triggered by gates for extra challenges.

### Management Phase (Home Base & Upgrades)
- Upgrade personal gear and mountain amenities.
- Repay initial loan to achieve the primary win condition.
- Persistent upgrades influencing overall progression.
